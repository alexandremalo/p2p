It has been claimed that the transformation of football from being a game into becoming a business is connected to Silvio Berlusconi and AC Milan.
As the owner of the club, Berlusconi introduced television, which he also owned, into
football. This step was quite successful as football became very popular in Italy
as well as being a sport that was in high demand4.
Another theory suggests that the first step towards business was made
by Alan Sugar and his club. Tottenham Hotspur became the first club to float on
the stock market in 1983. It wasn’t until the mid-90’s that the rest of football’s
chairmen saw this as a new way to make money. These were the first tentative
steps towards turning football from a sport into a business and an industry within
the entertainment sector. Supporters were no longer seen as fans but a ‘captive
market’ whose support was ‘inflexible’ as the more a club charged for tickets, the
more fans would pay.
Without a doubt, football has gained new shape and is no longer only a
sport but is now big business. New opportunities are opening up, therefore intelligent
actions are required. As in every business, the role of marketing is crucial
in the development of the football business
